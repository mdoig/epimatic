# EpiMatic: A random TV episode generator

This is EpiMatic, a random TV episode generator. You can use this app when you don't know what to watch, or if you get the urge to revisit _Breaking Bad_ but don't have time for a full rewatch.

Simply use the input field to search for the show you want to watch and click the show image in the results. Upon choosing a show, the name, season, number, airdate, and screenshot of a random episode appear. Then, presumably, you watch that episode. Didn't like the first result? Click the `Retry` button you're satisfied.

To start over, click the `Reset` button or make a new search.

**Disclaimer:** EpiMatic assumes you have the means to watch whatever episode it generates and is not responsible for a lack of access to any streaming services, boxed sets, Blu-rays, DVDs, VHS tapes, LaserDiscs, reruns, cable channels, broadcasts, kinescopes, or any other transmission or video storage formats.
